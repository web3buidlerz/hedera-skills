- Creating or managing tokens via smart contracts
- Scheduling transactions from within contracts
- Understanding HTS response codes and error handling
- Configuring token keys and permissions
- Working with token fees and compliance features

**References included (HTS):**

- `api.md` - HTS contract API reference (Solidity signatures)
- `structs.md` - Data structure definitions (HederaToken, TokenKey, Expiry)
- `response-codes.md` - Response codes with troubleshooting
- `keys.md` - Token key system reference
- `fees.md` - Fee structure information
- `compliance.md` - Compliance-related features
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions

**References included (HSS):**

- `api.md` - HSS contract API reference (Solidity signatures)

### native-services-js

Comprehensive guides for using Hedera native services with the Hiero JavaScript SDK. Covers setup patterns, transaction lifecycles, and common operations with working code examples.

**Skills included:**

- **hedera-token-service** — Token creation (fungible and NFT), minting, burning, transfers, key roles, compliance operations (KYC, freeze, wipe, pause), airdrops, and custom fees using the Hiero JS SDK.
- **hedera-consensus-service** — Topic creation, message submission with chunking support, subscription patterns via mirror nodes, topic management, and common patterns (event logs, pub/sub).

**Use when:**

- Building JavaScript/TypeScript apps that interact with Hedera Token Service
- Creating, minting, or transferring tokens using the Hiero JS SDK
- Working with Hedera Consensus Service topics and messages
- Setting up custom fees, compliance operations, or airdrops
- Subscribing to topic messages via mirror nodes

**References included (HTS):**

- `api-reference.md` - Hiero JS SDK API reference for HTS
- `custom-fees.md` - Custom fee configuration (fixed, fractional, royalty)

**References included (HCS):**

- `api-reference.md` - Hiero JS SDK API reference for HCS

### hackathon-helper

Two skills for Hedera hackathon participants: project planning and submission validation, both aligned to the official judging criteria. Compatible with any AI coding agent that supports skills (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.).

**Skills included:**

- **hackathon-prd** - Interactive PRD generator. Asks participants to paste their bounty/track context, gathers project details, then generates a comprehensive PRD (`HACKATHON-PRD.md`) with a predicted score and improvement tips.
- **validate-submission** - Codebase reviewer. Scans the repo for Hedera integration depth, code quality, and documentation, then produces a weighted scorecard against all 7 judging criteria with prioritized action items.

**Use when:**

- Starting a Hedera hackathon project and need a structured plan
- Want to ensure your project addresses all judging criteria
- Ready to validate your submission before the deadline
- Need to identify quick wins to improve your hackathon score

**Judging criteria covered:**

- Innovation (10%) - Novelty in the Hedera ecosystem
- Feasibility (10%) - Web3 necessity, business model, domain knowledge
- Execution (20%) - MVP quality, code quality, UI/UX, strategy
- Integration (15%) - Hedera service depth, ecosystem partners, creativity
- Validation (15%) - Market feedback, early adopters, traction
- Success (20%) - Hedera account growth, TPS impact, audience exposure
- Pitch (10%) - Problem/solution clarity, metrics, Hedera representation

### hedera-harness

Two skills for authoring and reviewing [hedera-harness](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hedera-harness) benchmark packs — the PRD, spec YAML, validators, Playwright smoke, and acceptance contract that drive Scaffold HBAR template generation. Compatible with any AI coding agent that supports skills.

**Skills included:**

- **harness-spec-author** — Interactive authoring workflow. Locates a harness clone (or reconstructs from references), gathers the product idea in batches, copies skeletons, emits a Tier 0–1 pack, recommends generator `skills:` names, and optionally deepens to Tier 2 / 3 / 3.5.
- **harness-spec-review** — Pack auditor. Checks cross-file name/path consistency, tier prerequisites, severity budget, thin Playwright, and oracle integrity (no contract text in the PRD), then reports blockers and warnings before a run.

**Use when:**

- Turning a Hedera demo idea into hedera-harness inputs
- Writing a harness PRD, spec, or acceptance contract
- Reviewing a benchmark pack before `harness run`
- Deciding which validation tiers to enable and in what order

**Important:** These are **authoring** skills. Do not list them in a template spec's `skills:` field — that list is vendored into generator workspaces. Use existing index names (`hedera-consensus-service`, `hts-system-contract`, …) there instead.

### dev-intelligence

AI development workflow toolkit — session continuity, quality gates, project scaffolding, and tech debt tracking for any codebase. Works with any language or framework.

**Skills included:**

- **session-management** — Report registry (15 categories), tech debt tracker (P0-P3 priorities), archive strategy for keeping session state lean across conversations.
- **quality-gates** — PostToolUse auto-validation hooks for TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Go. Deploy checklists and local CI pipeline patterns.
- **project-scaffolding** — Generate CLAUDE.md and `.claude/` directory structure for any project. Auto-detects stack, naming conventions, and build commands.

**Commands included:**

- `/continue` — Resume work with full context (git log, registry, tech debt)
- `/init` — Scaffold a project for AI development (interactive setup)
- `/debt` — View and manage tech debt tracker
- `/health` — Run project health check (git, tests, lint, dependencies)

**Use when:**

- Starting a new project and want AI-ready scaffolding
- Resuming work and need to pick up where you left off
- Want automatic validation after every file edit
- Tracking tech debt across sessions
- Running pre-deploy or pre-push quality checks

**Hooks included:**

- PostToolUse (Edit/Write) — Auto-runs stack-appropriate linter/type-checker after every edit
